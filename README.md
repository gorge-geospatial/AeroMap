# AeroMap
Simple desktop drone mapping application.

## Overview
Originally AeroMap was a port of the python ODM program. I've always been fascinated with the process of turning a bunch of pictures into highly accurate 2D maps and 3D models. OpenDroneMap (ODM specifically) really lays that process out clearly. Unfortunately - for me anyway - it's a python program & I'm a C programmer. So I set about converting it to C as an educational project - and what an education I got!

AeroMap can currently process RGB & thermal datasets with no ground control points. To be really useful, the program would have to at least handle GCPs and multispectral data sets.
